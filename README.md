# test_data_backend
Data for using to test backend for ecommerce app

In the tables folder you will find mysql for creating them. The data folder will contain some data, and the img folder is purely to allow working references for images that will be included.

Also make sure with your copy of the backend you create a .env with the following:

DB_USER=your user, default is root
DB_NAME=name of table, if using this data it is ecommerce_app
DB_PASS=your password for user
